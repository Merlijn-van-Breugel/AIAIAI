# NikeGAN

## Overview
This is code based on [this](https://youtu.be/yz6dNf7X7SA) video on Youtube by Siraj Raval. 
We'll use a WGAN to create new Nike sneakers. 

The credits for this code go to [moxiegushi](https://github.com/moxiegushi/pokeGAN). I've merely created a wrapper to get people started.
